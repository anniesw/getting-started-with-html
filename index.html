<p><b>The Pieces of the Web - Major Concepts</b><br>

	1. Web browser - A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web<br>
	2. Internet - The world's largest computer network<br>
	3. HTTP - The main protocol of the web which communicates back and forth between the internet and the servers<br>
  4. Servers - The computers that host the files that make up the web<br></p>

<p><b>The Pieces of HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</b><br>

Text content = What you see<br>
Markup = What it looks like (tells the web browser how to display a web page's words and images)<br>
References to other documents like images or videos
Links to other pages<br>
<br>
  <b>HTML Tag Overview</b><br>
	1. There are opening and closing tags and the name of the tag is always the same<br> 
	2. The opening tag (the word or letter) is surrounded by a less than and greater than symbol<br>
	3. The closing tag is exactly the same as the opening tag with the addition of a slash in front of the tag name/lettter that appears just after the less than symbol<br>
	4. The whole of the tag (with the opening and closing tag) is called an element<br>
	5. If you leave off the end tag then the tag never ends (example, if you do opening tag for italics which is <em> and never add in an end tag of </em> then all of the content in the document will be in italics<br>
<br>
  <b>Some HTML Tag Basics:</b>
<br><br>

  <b>Anchors</b><br>Provide the ability to create a link that when clicked on goes to a web page<br><br>

  <b>Line Break</b><br>This is a void tag which allows you to put text on multiple lines.  You'll notice that all of your HTML appears on a single line without a line break tag or a paragraph tag.  The line break tag is an inline void tag which means it does not require an end tag. Without a line break or a paragraph break, all content in HTML appears on a single line (whitespace)
  <br><br>

  <b>Paragraph</b><br>This tag to create a paragraph (with an invisible box arount the content which can have both height and width).  It is not a void tag so it requires both an opening and a closing tag
  <br><br>

  <b>The following HTML tags are inline elements:</b><br>
Bold, Italic, Image, Href (to insert a link), Strong, Span, Break<br><br>

  <b>The following are HTML tags are block elements</b> (used to create an imaginary box around the content):<br>
Paragraph, Form, Div (all this does is contain its contents)<br><br>

  <b>HTML Document Structure</b><br>
1. Start with the Document type <!Doctype HTML> with open and close <html> tags that surround the entire document<br>

2. Add a document head tag which = Meta data, Javascript (JS), CSS<br>

3. Add a title tag (open and closed tags)<br> 

4. Add a body tag (open and closed tags) which are the contents of the document<br>

5. Use CSS to add styles to the HTML document
